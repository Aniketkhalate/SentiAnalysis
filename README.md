This is a project on Sentiment Analysis.
I have implemented web scrapping for collecting text from various websites for analysis.
Firstly the code collects text from websites and stores it in a text file and then performs text analysis on it.
It can calculate various parameters such as Syllable count, FOG Index, average word length, personal pronouns, average number of words per sentence, percentage of complex words.
