This is a project on Sentiment Analysis.
I have implemented web scrapping for collecting text from various websites for analysis.
Firstly, the code collects text from websites, stores it in a text file, and then performs text analysis on it.
It can calculate parameters such as Syllable count, FOG Index, average word length, personal pronouns, average number of words per sentence, and percentage of complex words.
I have used an Excel sheet to store a list of websites and used that same sheet for analysis in the program.
